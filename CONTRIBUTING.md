# Contributing
`gfsR` welcomes contributions from other users. If you have a bug or a feature request please start by filing an issue and describing the nature of the bug or enhancement your contribution addresses. Once an issue has been filed please open a new branch dedicated to the issue. This is easily accomplished on github under the Development heading in the menu on the right side of the issue. Feel free to self assign yourself to the issue also. Once the new branch has been created you will be able to work on your code on the branch without fear of impacting code on the main branch. When you are satisfied that the changes you have made are complete you can start a new pull request to main. At this point your changes will be reviewed and changes may be requested prior to the pull request being merged to main. You are able to test and continue to use your modified code on your local enviroment while you await approval. 

Thank you for using and contributing to this package.
